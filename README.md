# VueJS Projects

In this repository I put all the Vue projects I worked on using Laracasts.com and other workshops on the web to learn Vue.js .  Here is the list of the current projects I am working on and those that are done:

- Axios
- Basic Data Binding
- ES6
- Event Listeners: v-on
- My Vue Projects
- Twitter
- Lists:v-for

## Axios
Basic Axios - Promised Based HTTP Client - Ajax call loading Json from Laravel Route with array. Vue is used to add the data or skills in this case to the DOM using an empty array. Axios fills the array with data from the Larvel Route skills.

## Basic Databinding
Showing how you can reactively bind data to an input field using v-model as well as echoing the data using the moustache ```{{}}``` syntax.

## ES6
Basic ES6 (EMCA2015) example using ES6 Syntax and Babel to convert it to regular JavaScript which use can use cross-browser.

## Event Listeners
In this workshop event listeners are setup. The example using vanilla JavaScript is used first and then commented out:
```
document.querySelector('#button').addEventListener('click', () => {
	let name = document.querySelector('#input');
	app.names.push(name.value);
	name.value = ''; //empty the field
});
```
This to show how event listeners are set up in Vue JS with a lot less code and way easier then using JavaScript or jQuery.
